This directory contains the required tools compiled for macOS (compiled in a macOS Monterey version 12.6.2). If you use macoOS copy these file in the /MTUOC directory replacing the existing files compiled for Linux). Then give the files execution permisions:

```
chmod +x lmplz
chmod +x build_binary
chmod +x fast_align
chmod +x atools
```

Don't forget to give also execution permisions to eflomal-align.py

```
chmod +x eflomal-align.py
```

If you experience problems with these files, you may want to compile the files yourself.
